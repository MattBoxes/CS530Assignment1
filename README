Files: 	disassembler.cpp, disassembler.h, disassembler.o, dissem.exe, make.exe, makefile, objtest.lis, 
	objtest.obj, objtest.sic, objtest.sym, OpCode.cpp, OpCode.h, OpCode.o, README, sample-obj.txt, sample.lis.txt, 
	sample.sic.txt, sample.sym.txt

Compile Instructions: 	Run makefile
Operating Instructions: dissem .\objtest.obj .\objtest.lis

The main function of the program is disassembler.cpp. This function will load in two files: the objtest.obj and objtest.lis.
	- .obj file contains the object code
	- .sym file contains both symtab and littab
		- symtab describes each symbol within a program such as name, address and flag address.
		- littab is the literal table that describes the literal: name, length, and address.

The program will output objtest.lis:
	- .lis file: contains the assembly source code which was formed from both the .obj and .sym files

Instructions:
	1) Copy all files into the same local directory.
	2) type "make" and enter to compile the program
	3) type "dissem .\objtest.obj .\objtest.lis" and enter
	4) the program will output a .lis file in the same directory
